# Welcome to the Validator Analysis challenges! 

This repository contains solutions for the provided validator challenges. 

## Prerequisites

<ol>
<li> Make sure you have `go v18` or higher installed. You can check this by entering `go version` in your terminal or download go [here](https://go.dev/dl/). </li>
<li> Clone this repository </li>
</ol>

## Start the program

To start the program make sure you're in the project's directory and run `go run main.go output01.go output02.go output03.go output04.go`.
This will start a CLI application where you can chose which challenge you want to execute. The yellow highlighted challenge is your current selection that you can change with the arrows for up or down. Chose by pressing enter/return. 

## Results

You can see the results popping up in the same directory. Keep in mind that querying the node might take a while, so please don't abort the programm manually. 

After that, you can take a look at the provided CSV and asses the results. There are reference outputs in the same-named folder. There might be changes in your result as we are querying the live node during the program executing. The reference outputs were created on December 6th, 2022.
